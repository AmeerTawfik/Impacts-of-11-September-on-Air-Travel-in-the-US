# Impacts-of-11-September-on-Air-Travel-in-the-US
An Introduction To The Problem. "Background"
* The Research and Innovative Technology Administration's Bureau of Transportation Statistics conducted a study to assess the impact of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on transportation in the US. The study aimed to analyze passenger travel behaviour patterns before and after 9/11. The report and data from the 2006 study can be found at link in the notebook.

Data Analysis:
*The study analyzed monthly passenger movement data between January 1990 and May 2004. The provided dataset, named Sept11Travel.csv, includes three monthly time series: actual airline revenue passenger miles (Air), rail passenger miles (Rail), and vehicle miles travelled (Car). To evaluate the impact of September 11, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics employed the following approach: they forecasted future data based on pre-September 11 information, assuming no terrorist attack, and compared the forecasted series with the actual data to determine the event's impact. Initially, the focus is on the pre-event time series.
