        "#### The Research and Innovative Technology Administration's Bureau of Transportation Statistics conducted a study to assess the impact of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on transportation in the US. The study aimed to analyze passenger travel behaviour patterns before and after 9/11. The report and data from the 2006 study can be found at [here](https://www.bts.gov/archive/publications/estimated_impacts_of_9_11_on_us_travel/index).\n",
        "---\n",
        "### Data Analysis:\n",
        "#### The study analyzed monthly passenger movement data between January 1990 and May 2004. The provided dataset, named Sept11Travel.csv, includes three monthly time series: actual airline revenue passenger miles (Air), rail passenger miles (Rail), and vehicle miles travelled (Car). To evaluate the impact of September 11, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics employed the following approach: they forecasted future data based on pre-September 11 information, assuming no terrorist attack, and compared the forecasted series with the actual data to determine the event's impact. Initially, the focus is on the pre-event time series.\n",

        "2. #### Figure 17.11 shows a time plot of the seasonally adjusted pre-September-11 AIR series. Which of the following methods would be adequate for forecasting the series shown in the figure? [Go to S.2](#S.2)\n",

        "    - #### Fitted Linear Regression Mdel To respected Columns With Additive Seasonality and Linear Trend `SARIMAX`.\n",

        "    - #### Forecasted Each of The Three `post-event` Series Using The Estimatted Models.\n",
        "    - #### Stored The Forecasted Values Into `post-event` DataFrame.\n",
        "    - #### Plotted The `pre-event` Actual `Air RPM, Rail PM, VMT` Values Against The Corresponding Dates.\n",
        "    - #### Plotted The `post-event` Actual `Air RPM, Rail PM, VMT` Values Against The Corresponding Dates.\n",
        "    - #### Determined What Can Be Said About The Effect Of The September 11 Terrorist Attack on Thethree Modes of Transportation, The Magnitude of The Effect, Its Time Span, ....\n",
        "        + ##### `Answer:` Based On The Observations From The Graps Below, It Can Be Concluded That The September 11 Attack Had A Notable Effect on `Air Transportation`, With a Visible Drop In The Post-event Period. However, `Rail` and `VMT` Do Not Exhibit Significant Changes In The Post-event Series."
